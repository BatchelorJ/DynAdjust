* ITRFxx - ITRFxx transformations rely upon the Australian plate motion 
  model (pmm) when transforming between epochs. Accordingly, incorrect 
  results will be produced when transforming coordinates and baselines
  associated with stations located on tectonic plates other than the 
  Australian plate. For a list of the 14 tectonic plates, see:
  https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011JB008930#jgrb17142-tbl-0003
  To produce correct results irrespective of location on the earth,
  further work is required:
  - If a pmm is needed, determine the pmm on which a station resides
  - Assign the pmm parameters in the transformation.
