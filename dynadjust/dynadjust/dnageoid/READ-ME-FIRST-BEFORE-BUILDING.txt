BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR dnageoid.dll

When building dnageoid.dll with standard C API:
1.	On line 50 of dnageoid.hpp, uncomment the following line to define BUILD_DNAGEOID_C_DLL

	//  #define BUILD_DNAGEOID_C_DLL

2.	Optionally, add def file to project
	.\dynadjust_1_00_00\dynadjust\dnageoid\dnageoid_ext.def
	dnageoid > Properties > Configuration Properties > Linker > Input > Module Definition File = dnageoid_ext.def

	Note: this def file doesn't need to be included in order to build driver, but
	should be included to permit backward compatibility.  That is, if a new exported method is added to the dll,
	programs which rely on this dll don't need to be recompiled because the def file preserves the order of
	the entry points. This way, new versions of dnageoid.dll can be rebuilt without having to rebuild the driver.
